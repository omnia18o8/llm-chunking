    "- We avoid grouping by actual document to allow flexibility and even similarity across unrelated chunks\n",
    "- Group size (`GROUP_SIZE`) is tuned to stay below the 32k token limit of `voyage-context-3`\n",

      "\n",
      "Q4: Write a 500 word report on what are the key components that should be included in a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy to ensure inclusivity and support for all employees?\n",
      "Answer: A workplace reproductive and fertility health policy plays a crucial role in supporting employees facing challenges related to their reproductive health. To ensure inclusivity and support for all employees, several key components must be included in such a policy. This report will outline these essential components that should be considered when creating or revising a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Essential Policies:\n",
      "The first key component that should be included in a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy is to clearly outline essential policies that support employees facing reproductive health challenges. This includes policies surrounding flexible work and leave, health benefits and insurance, and reasonable accommodations. Providing employees with clear guidelines on how to access support for fertility treatments, pregnancy loss, menopause, and other reproductive health-related concerns is crucial for creating a supportive environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Clarity in Communication:\n",
      "Another important component of a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy is to ensure that the information provided is communicated clearly and concisely. Using simple, accessible language and breaking down processes into step-by-step guidance can help employees navigate the resources available to them. Additionally, providing clear points of contact within HR, employee assistance programs, and external resources is essential for ensuring employees know where to turn for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Inclusivity and Accessibility:\n",
      "Inclusivity and accessibility are key components that should be prioritized in a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy. The policy should be inclusive of all genders, sexual orientations, and family structures to ensure that every employee feels supported and valued. Addressing cultural and religious considerations around reproductive health is also important to create a welcoming and inclusive environment. Offering the policy in multiple formats, such as digital, print, and audio, can enhance accessibility and ensure that all employees can easily access the information they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Addressing Workplace Culture and Stigma:\n",
      "Addressing workplace culture and stigma surrounding reproductive health is another critical component of a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy. Providing education on reproductive health-related biases and how they impact employees, as well as outlining strategies for managers and HR to foster an open and supportive culture, can help reduce stigma and create a more supportive work environment. Encouraging confidentiality and psychological safety in reproductive health discussions is also important for ensuring that employees feel comfortable seeking support.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, a workplace reproductive and fertility health policy should include key components that prioritize inclusivity and support for all employees facing reproductive health challenges. By outlining essential policies, communicating clearly, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility, and addressing workplace culture and stigma, organizations can create a supportive environment where employees feel valued and supported in managing their reproductive health needs. It is essential for organizations to continuously review and update their policies to meet the evolving needs of their workforce and create a workplace that is truly inclusive and supportive for all employees.\n"
